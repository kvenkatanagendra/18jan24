        <p>geographical factors. In fact, the study embraced basic data storage, information retrieval, and the use and sharing of knowledge bases which had evolved in each of the organisations: in many ways, the knowledge issues proved to be the most interesting and challenging.</p>
        <p>We were given a framework within which to operate, which was defined in relation to enhanced customer service, “best value”, economies of scale, and more effective working. The output required was a “draft report for further consideration, detailing the options for Inter-County Joint Emergency Service sharing and exchange of caller information”.</p>
        <p>Specifically, the specification of the study can be defined as below.</p>
        <h2>Problem Content, Scope and Objectives </h2>
        <hr color=black size=5>
        <ul>
        <li>An examination of the current arrangements between Barfordshire Police, Ambulance and Paramedic Service, and Fire & Rescue Service for the sharing and exchange of caller information between the services.</li>
        <li>An exploration into the feasibility of enhancing the sharing and exchange of caller information between the above, taking into account: technological potential and constraints; organisational issues; geographical factors.</li></ul>
        <h2>Project Outcomes</h2> <hr color=black size=5>
       
        <ul><li>A feasibility study looking at joint working in the exchange and sharing of caller information, and yielding the potential benefits of: enhanced customer service, “best value”, economies of scale, and more effective working.</li></ul>
        <h2>Outline Project Deliverables and/or Desired Outcomes</h2><hr color=black size=5>
        <p>A Draft Report for further consideration, detailing the options for Inter-County Joint Emergency Service sharing and exchange of caller information.</p>
        <center><h1>The Approach</h1></center><hr color=black size=5>
        <h2>Purpose</h2><hr color=black size=5>
        <p>The project was conducted within the Best Value framework (AuditCommission 1998). Best Value was a U.K. Government initiative of the time, a key purpose of which was to improve public services, especially at a local level. A series of three participative sessions were held to inform the study and to contribute to the “consult” (AuditCommission 2000) element of Best Value. The events would also contribute to informing the ‘challenge’ element of the Best Value framework and potentially enable people to question the rationale for the current fragmented emergency service call handling and information sharing processes.</p>
        <p>It was felt that a participative approach involving people from all the organisations involved would begin to breakdown any organisational cultural barriers and begin to develop a common understanding of how the different organisations worked.</p>
        <h2>Process</h2><hr color=black size=5>
        <p>The participative sessions were held on three separate days, one to develop the issues about the organisations working together and two others to gain information about technical (IT) issues and human resources issues respectively.</p>
        <p>The initial event was an open space (Owen, 1997) session where approximately 20 people from each of the Ambulance and Police Services attended. Two later sessions concentrated on the technical and HR aspects of greater collaboration and attendees were fewer in number and limited to the experts in the areas being explored, namely information technology and human resources. For these two later events, interactive planning (Ackoff 1981) and critical systems heuristics (Ulrich 1983) were used. All the organisations involved except the Fire services were represented. These remaining organisations found elements of common ground and began to explore the technical and HR issues.</p>
        <p>The events took the form of a chaired discussion testing ideas and assumptions about collaboration between the organisations. The experts shared technical information about their IT systems and began to explore the potential for working together. Lists of issues raised were produced by each group which informed the study.</p>
        <h2>Findings</h2><hr color=black size=5>
        <p>The participative sessions highlighted the problem of engagement for the organisations that would have been masked had they not been held. The project board formed with executive officers from each of the emergency services appeared to exhibit a broad consensus about the value of exploring the potential for collaborative work. However,that commitment was tested demonstrably when it came to sending people to the participative sessions. In terms of participation, non-attendance speaks volumes about the commitment of participants within a partnership. The issues about these emergency services collaborating in call handling or information sharing were exposed as being
primarily human centred, cultural and managerial and less about the technical issues.</p>
        <p>Similar problems have been experienced in another area of the United Kingdom where the emergency services were actively working towards a shared control room, but the cultural and human centred issues have got in the way of implementation. </p>
        <center><h1>Findings of Feasibility Study</h1></center><hr color=black size=5>
        <p>The comments in this section should be seen in the context of access to the Fire Service being only at Principal Officer level. Access to Fire control rooms in Barfordshire has not been possible. A joint Ambulance and Fire Service control room has been visited at Warwickshire, and the visits to three joint control (Fire, Police and Ambulance) sites in Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Cleveland provided further information, although none of these three sites was operational at the time of the study.</p>
        <h2>Organisational Feasibility</h2><hr color=black size=5>
        <p>The services share their knowledge on a daily, operational basis, via telephone between control rooms, and person to person communication at incident locations. There is, however, no sharing of information on an organised basis. NB: At the time of the study, the Home Office was championing the implementation of a new combined radio and other data communication system called Airwave (www.airwaveservice.co.uk).</p>
        <p>Enhancing the sharing of information implies improved enabling technologies for such sharing, including the new public service radio communications platform, and mobile data/automatic vehicle location.</p>
        <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Improved enabling technologies for information sharing.</p>
            <ul  >
            <li type="a"> Airwave or an equivalent communication platform [note that there is strong evidence—per Jack Straw (Home Secretary): see Police Information Technology Organisation Web site (www.pito.org.uk)—that all Police forces will be committed to Airwave; as I write, all forces have agreed to take it]. More information is needed to evaluate Airwave, and plan other technologies and the necessary organisational procedures around them.</li>
           
            <li type="a"> Mobile data, linked with automatic vehicle location, is a major opportunity for data sharing between agencies. IT applications providing learning systems  based on these technologies are available now.</li></ul>
        
            <p>All of this adds up to a major management tool for the deployment of resources based on mapping systems, and according to known and targeted response levels.</p>
        <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information sharing at other than operational levels.</p>
        <p>There is evidence of sharing information at other than operational levels, of which the Inter County Joint Emergency Services Group in Barfordshire is an example. However, an overall explicit, articulated strategic focus, shared by all, is lacking. The situation with Airwave, which admittedly is driven by Government and therefore not entirely within the control of even the three services on a national basis, highlights this. A given service (e.g., the Police) is expected to “buy in” to Airwave: but none of the following questions are systematically addressed: where does this fit with communication strategies overall; what is the long term view; what about mobile data; what are the operational considerations?</p>
        <p>PITO (Police Information Technology Organisation) is charged by government with designing common IS and IT  requirements for implementation across all Police services in England and Wales. This brings added complications concerning the ability of individual forces to change IS and IT in line with government requirements, given the need to improve some systems immediately and the competing pressure to conform to a PITO standard that might be several years away from readiness. This situation is further complicated by the narrow development of Police IS and IT, and probably Ambulance and Fire, in not designing systems that integrate the three services. A notable exception being Cleveland Police where they have employed integrated IS for a number of years.</p>
        
        <h2>Structure Issues</h2><hr color=black size=5>
        <p>e organisational structure of Fire, Police and Ambulance Services has been investigated through visits to sites and discussions with relevant personnel.</p>
        <p>A number of issues related to structure became clearer as a result of this study. For example, one overriding issue was the different levels of complexity within each of the services in handling caller information. In general terms, the Fire Service seems to have the most clearly defined procedures, which are easiest to follow. The Ambulance Service control systems exhibit more complexity, and a greater need for overall management, whilst mostly occurring under resource pressure. The Police Service has a much wider remit, with a wider variety and greater number of calls, requiring considerably more decision-making at the point of call receipt.</p>
        
        <p>Consequently, the two Police Services have to “manage” demand in order to meet the needs of their clients. Whilst the Fire Service deals only with emergency calls, and the Ambulance Service has clear categories of calls to which it has to respond, and which it prioritises. This gives the Ambulance Service a particular problem, in that it has to manage the knowledge relating to its own activities or those of the Fire and Police Services, on, at times, a minute-by-minute basis. As an example, an emergency call to the Fire Service is always responded to. The vehicles and teams to send are, for the most part, allocated according to set rules and procedures. These rules and procedures are such that they can be incorporated within an automated system. Except in major emergencies, control of the incident, from inception of the instruction to eventual return to station, can be left largely with the operational fire teams attending the incident—central coordination is much less of an issue than with Ambulance or Police</p>
        <h7><i>Ambulance Service</i></h7><hr color=black size=1>
        <p>The Ambulance Service for Barfordshire has a control centre in Barford. The centre uses a computerised system for call taking and despatch, included within which (currently available or planned) are mapping, mobile data and automated vehicle location systems (AVLS). The system uses a single radio system. Ambulance and Paramedic Service command and control is supplied by a proprietory system.</p>
        <P>The Ambulance and Paramedic Service call taking and despatch system is an example of a system often under severe resource pressure, frequently resulting in a need to carefully schedule vehicles to meet the current demand. Any joint working which can enhance Ambulance and Paramedic Service performance is estimated to yield immediate benefits
            in terms of response times, which are subject to National targets.</P>
        <h7><i>Police Service</i></h7><hr color=black size=1>
        <p>The Police Service for Barfordshire has two central control centres (or “information centres”). One, in Barford, has recently been refurbished, and monitors all calls across the County. A computer system is used, together with UHF and VHF radio systems (now replaced). There is no AVLS or mapping, and no mobile data. The other, in a neighbouring county town, is in the process of rolling out the Airwave implementation. The same computer system as that in Barford is used (although the procedures for using it differ), together with UHF and VHF radio systems (now replaced). There is no AVLS or mapping, and no systematic application of mobile data [e.g., the Armed Response Vehicles (ARVs) use laptops to link in to central systems remotely].</p>
        <p>Police Services have to “manage” demand in order to meet the needs of their clients. Forces have adopted systems of “graded response” which they apply to calls for service. For example, Grade 1—immediate response, grade 2—respond but at normal traffic speeds, grade 3—by appointment, grade 4—no police attendance required. As mentioned earlier, whilst the Fire Service deals only with emergency calls, and the Ambulance Service has clear categories of calls to which it has to respond, and which it prioritises, the range of calls which the Police Service has to respond to is much more varied. A distinction is made between emergency and non-emergency calls, but the classification of a call as emergency or non-emergency is not always clear cut. This is an issue which impacts future development, and to which I will return later in the report.</p>
        <h7><i>Fire Service</i></h7><hr color=black size=1>
        <p>In the case of the Fire Service, there have been limited opportunities to assess the operation, but from the evidence gathered it is possible to make the following preliminary assessment of the emergency systems:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>An emergency call to the Fire Service is always responded to.</li>
        <li>The vehicles and teams to send are, for the most part, allocated according to set rules and procedures. These rules and procedures are such that they can be incorporated within an automated system.</li>
        <li> Calls can be dealt with by a call taker/dispatcher, who, on receipt of the call, is able to generate an automated instruction, resulting in hard copy (e.g., computer printout) information at the relevant Fire station.
</li></ol>
